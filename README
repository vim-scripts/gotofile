This script defines a new command 'GotoFile', which resembles the normal
'gf' function, but uses a standard tags file generated by ctags for
looking up the file name under the cursor. 

You need to generate a standard tags file (with ctags) for this script to work.
Add the following ctags option for generating filename tags: --extra=+f

For example: ctags -R --extra=+f

Add the following mapping to your .vimrc (or _vimrc) to replace the
normal 'gf' behavior by the GotoFile command:

nmap <silent> gf :GotoFile<CR>

I wrote this script mainly for having an alternative for setting the
path and using 'gf'. While using completion all header files within
the path are also searched, which causes a major performance hit for
large projects (at least for me). So this script allows using the
'gf' feature without setting the path. Other suggestions are welcome!
